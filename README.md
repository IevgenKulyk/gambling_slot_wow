Easy slot gambling game developed for the test of my skills

The main idea was to show how is it possible to use MVC pattern in developing of simple games interracting with user.
This is the first release when it's present the working copy of engine. Still the matrix generator is stupid and cannot
generate really smart values to make the user loose his/her money (the task was to make 94 % difference).

The code should be refactored a bit, tests will be fixed and modified strongly.
